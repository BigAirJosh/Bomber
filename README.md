# Bomber
Inspired by an old Amiga game called "Biplanes", Bomber is a two player game built using Java.

I coded this game during a three day Java training course I had at IBM, I got bored in the first ten minutes and decided to have some fun :)

Enjoy... 

## Objective
Drop your bombs on the target to achieve the high score.  See if you can figure out how to score 11 points with only 10 bombs!

##Running
Launch the BomberGame class to start the game
